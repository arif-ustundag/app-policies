## 5. Your Privacy Rights and Choices

We are committed to providing you with control over your personal information, in compliance with major data protection laws.

#### **A. Consent for EEA, UK, and Turkish Users (GDPR & KVKK)**

If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, or the Republic of Türkiye, you will be presented with a consent screen before we or our partners process your personal data for personalized advertising. This is done to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Türkiye's Law on the Protection of Personal Data (KVKK). You can give consent, refuse consent, or customize your choices. You may change your consent preferences at any time within the App's settings menu.

#### **B. Rights for California Residents (CCPA/CPRA)**

If you are a resident of California, you have specific rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). This includes the right to opt-out of the "sale" or "sharing" of your personal information. When using our App from California, you will be provided with a notice and an option to opt-out, which you can access via a "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information" link.

#### **C. Managing Your Advertising ID**

You can limit ad personalization at any time through your device's settings. For Android devices, the typical path is:
**Settings $\rightarrow$ Google $\rightarrow$ Ads $\rightarrow$ "Delete advertising ID"**.
This will prevent apps from using your ID to show you personalized ads, though you will still see contextual (non-personalized) ads.

## 6. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to help protect your information from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access. However, please be aware that no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.

This App is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of consent in your region, which may be up to 16 in some European countries). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with information, please contact us so we can take steps to delete it.
